# JSII-rs

> This project is not even alpha, I just created it to learn about JSII internals and Rust. It's not meant to be used in production and I'm not certain it ever will be.

[JSII](https://aws.github.io/jsii/)'s core part rewritten in Rust. The goal is to improve the compilation speed by a lot

## Features

- [ ] Compiles JSII assembly

## Usage

See the [JSII](https://aws.github.io/jsii/) docs for now, I'll write proper docs once I have the first tests working.
